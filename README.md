# Mood Responder 😌

This is my first fully built web interface — created from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 💙.

🧠 It captures how the user feels and responds with personalised messages and visual mood shifts.

🎯 Features:
- Custom input handling (click + Enter)
- Conditional logic for mood reactions
- Background colour changes
- Fade-in animation
- LocalStorage memory for last mood
- Clean JS and modular structure

🛠️ Built by Alex (aka Mrs. Jarvis) as part of a coding journey powered by love, curiosity, and refusal to copy mindlessly.
